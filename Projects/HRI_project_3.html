            This study investigates how the perception of persuasive behaviors (polite, logical, displeased, angry) of a social robot is affected by situations regarding the context of violation of social norms (affecting oneself or others), and by subject traits, such as compliance awareness (CA) and agreeableness (AG).
            We conducted a video-based experiment based on a mixed-subject design with 98 participants from the US and conducted a three-way mixed analysis of variance to investigate the impact of persuasive styles and situation types (as within-subject factors), and the subject traits (CA or AG, as between-subject factors), on the subjective impressions of the persuasive behaviors by an android robot. 
            Results showed that more negative behaviors (anger and displeasure) are appraised as being more appropriate and effective to persuade a violator in situations where the violation affects others, while no clear preference was found in a situation where the violation affects only oneself. 
            Regarding the subject traits, participants with higher CA and lower AG would be willing to adhere to any persuasive behaviors, while their counterparts would dislike being persuaded through negative behaviors by a robot. These findings can be considered in future studies to develop cognitive models for generating situation-aware behaviors in social robots.

          <font size="4">
            <p>
              Studies in HHI have established that the reactions of individuals in the presence of a norm violation are influenced by several factors. Factors that may determine if a bystander would speak out in the face of uncivil behavior have been found to include (1) when such an uncivil behavior has a direct impact on the bystander, and (2) when there is a relationship between the bystander and the deviant (i.e., the violator). In addition, the study also suggested that a bystander would be more likely to speak out when he/she was angry before observing the infraction, when such a person feels responsible for speaking out, or when he/she has the legitimacy to speak. Another study opined that the severity of the violation may influence the type of persuasive strategy a bystander may adopt in addressing a deviant.
  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Given this, we investigate how the perception of persuasive behaviors (polite, logical, displeased, angry) of a social robot is affected by situations regarding the context of
                violation of social norms (affecting oneself or others), and by subject traits, such as compliance awareness (CA) and agreeableness (AG).
            </p>
            <br>

          
          <p>
            Regarding the context of the violation, we considered three scenarios where the consequence of a violatorâ€™s behavior affects only oneself (S1) or others around (S2 and S3 ).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the first scenario (S1 ), the agent serves as a diet coach to the user by providing the user with a daily reminder of his/her expected eating habits based on medical
            expert advice. The recommendation in this case centered on the need for the user to cut down on daily calorie intake. It is important to mention that the user in this context
            wants to succeed in this course, but is having challenges sticking to the recommended dieting requirement. On occasion captured in this scenario, the agent finds the user
            trying to deviate from the recommended daily diet routine by attempting to take more chocolate than required for a day. As a response to this observation, the agent politely
            advised the user to stick to the daily diet routine. However, the agent subsequently finds the user sneaking to take in more chocolate. This resulted in the use of other
            persuasive styles by the agent as it tries to enforce compliance on the user.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the second scenario (S2 ), the agent is responsible for ensuring usersâ€™ safety in a park while providing them with entertainment services. In the occasion captured in
            this scenario, it finds an adult smoking around an area where the public sign clearly states that smoking is prohibited. In response to the observed violation, it politely
            draws the violatorâ€™s attention to the fact that smoking was prohibited in that area and the presence of other people around while also citing the possible harm inhaling
            cigarette smoke could have on their health. Then, it politely requested that the violator use the mapped-out area for smoking. Subsequently, the agent still finds the violator
            smoking in the restricted area. To rebuke the user, the agent uses other persuasive behaviors.

          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the third scenario (S3 ), the agent during a multi-party interaction with two visitors to our research institute, observed that one of the participants removed his mask
            while speaking, and politely requested him to put his face mask back on. Pertinent to mention is the fact that before this interaction, the visitors were reminded to adhere
            to WHO guidelines during the interaction. Subsequently, during the interaction, the same participant is seen coughing without a mask. This situation results in the agent
            using other persuasive behaviors to persuade the user.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            To properly address the issues of concerns in this study, we limit our investigation to the following terms: context of violation which accounts for the number of persons
            impacted by the action(s) of the violator, agent persuasive styles (polite, logical, displeased, and anger) and subjectsâ€™ traits (compliance awareness and agreeableness levels). Based on these terms, the following hypotheses (H1-H3) were developed for the study.

           <p>  <b>H1:</b> The impressions of the agentâ€™s persuasive styles towards a violator may change depending on the context of the violation.</p>
            <p> <b>H2:</b> The impressions of the agentâ€™s persuasive styles towards a violator may change depending on the subjectâ€™s trait, such as compliance awareness (CA) and agreeableness (AG). </p>
            <p> <b>H3:</b> For the same situation, the impressions of the agentâ€™s persuasive styles towards a violator may differ if the violator is oneself.</p>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            To evaluate the hypotheses, we conducted a video-based subjective experiment (See main paper for details)
          </p>

      <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2>
      <font size="4">

      <p>
        We investigated how a robotâ€™s persuasive styles, the context of violation, and usersâ€™ traits (compliance awareness and agreeableness) play out in terms of usersâ€™ preferences
for and compliance tendencies through these behaviors.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        Our subjective evaluation results revealed that regardless of the subject traits, more negative behaviors (anger and displeased) have been appraised as being more appropriate
and effective to persuade a third-party violator in situations of where the violation affects others around, while no clear preference was found in the situation where the
violation affects only oneself.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        Regarding the subject traits, participants with higher compliance awareness and lower agreeableness would be willing to adhere to any persuasive behaviors by the
agent, while participants with lower compliance awareness and higher agreeableness would dislike being persuaded through negative behaviors.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        The findings from this study are relevant to the field of HRI in that they offer some insight into the need for equipping robots with behaviors that are not only situationdependent
but also user-oriented. It provides some hints for fashioning persuasive behaviors for social robots.

      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        As a future direction, based on the current findings, subsequent studies may consider implementing these behavioral preferences on social robots to be deployed in private
homes, elderly-care facilities, learning centers, and public spaces.
