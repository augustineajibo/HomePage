        We investigate the perceived impressions on the use of agents who enforce WHO guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic while considering the different strands of
        perspectives among people and the need to adhere to guidelines for their own safety and that of others. We investigate how adequately an agent’s harmonized expressive behaviors (polite, gentle, displeased, and angry) can be effectively utilized to elicit
        adherence to WHO guidelines on social distancing and masks. A female android robot, ERICA, was adopted for this study. Her audio-visual expressions during the interactions were generated based on the analysis results in this study as well
        as previous studies on gesture generation in polite and anger expressions.

            Motivated by the fact that some human emotional expressions promote affiliating functions such as signaling, social change, and support, all of which have been established as providing social benefits, we investigated how these behaviors can be extended to Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios.
            We explored how to furnish an android robot with socially motivated expressions geared toward eliciting adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. 
            We analyzed how different behaviors associated with social expressions in such situations occur in Human-Human Interaction (HHI) and designed a scenario where a robot utilizes context-inspired behaviors (polite, gentle, displeased, and angry) to enforce social compliance.
            We then implemented these behaviors in an android robot and subjectively evaluated how effectively it expressed them and how they were perceived in terms of their appropriateness, effectiveness, and tendency to enforce social compliance to COVID19 guidelines.
            We also considered how the subjects’ sense of values regarding compliance awareness would affect the robot’s behavior impressions. 
            Our evaluation results indicated that participants generally preferred polite behaviors by a robot, although participants with different levels of compliance awareness manifested different trends toward appropriateness and effectiveness for social compliance enforcement through negative expressions by the robot. </p>

          <font size="4">

          <p>
            Studies in HHI have established that the reactions of individuals in the presence of a norm violation are influenced by several factors. Factors that may determine if a bystander would speak out in the face of uncivil behavior have been found to include (1) when such an uncivil behavior has a direct impact on the bystander, and (2) when there is a relationship between the bystander and the deviant (i.e., the violator). In addition, the study also suggested that a bystander would be more likely to speak out when he/she was angry before observing the infraction, when such a person feels responsible for speaking out, or when he/she has the legitimacy to speak. Another study opined that the severity of the violation may influence the type of persuasive strategy a bystander may adopt in addressing a deviant.

          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Given this, we investigate how the perception of persuasive behaviors (polite, logical, displeased, angry) of a social robot is affected by situations regarding the context of
              violation of social norms (affecting oneself or others), and by subject traits, such as compliance awareness (CA) and agreeableness (AG).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            During the world's COVID-19 pandemic, many people do not feel comfortable obeying WHO guidelines about the use of face masks and social distancing,
            perhaps owing to the inconveniences associated with such rules and the fact that no direct penalties have been enacted for non-observance. Some people are 
            skeptical about the severity of the pandemic and have low compliance awareness concerning the need to uphold these rules. Faced with these challenges, 
            eliciting social compliance becomes complicated, since violators may react differently to appeals to conscientious actions or verbal shaming. Of course, 
            some respond to voluntary appeals or reprimands. Others accept polite reprimands, and still others might be influenced by repeated admonitions in the form of displeasure
            or intense expressions of angers. We then sought to determine to what extent an agent's context-inspired behaviors (polite, gentle, displeased, and angry) are considered 
            socially appropriate, effective, and have a higher tendency of effecting desired social changes in those who have a different sense of values regarding compliance awareness
            on WHO guidelines.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Therefore, we designed a video-based user study of a scenario in which a robot agent and two visitors engage in a multi-party interaction at our research institute. 
            Prior to this interaction, these visitors were reminded to adhere to the WHO guidelines during their interactions with the agent. However, during the interaction,
            the agent observes that one of the participants removed his mask while speaking and politely requested him to put it back on. Subsequently during the interaction, 
            the same participant is seen coughing without a mask. This situation results in three optional reprimands from the agent: polite/gentle, displeased, and angry
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            We recorded four scenes that captured the described scenario. Based on this scenario and our established objective, we developed the following hypotheses (H1 and H2)
            that center on an individual's sense of values regarding compliance awareness on WHO's COVID-19 guidelines and relationship to the behavioral preferences of reprimands 
            toward others (third-party violators) and oneself (individual violator). We provide an initial estimate as to how these relationships might occur.

          </p>
          <br>
          
           <p>  <b>H1:</b> From a third person perspective, subjects with lower levels of compliance awareness (LCA) will show lower preference for behaviors with negative expression (displeased and angry) of the agent, as appropriate or effective for enforcing desired social changes in persons who violate WHO guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects with higher levels of compliance awareness (HCA) will show higher preference for behaviors with negative expressions as more appropriate and effective for enforcing desired social changes toward third-party violators.</p>
           <br> 
           <p> <b>H2:</b> From an individual perspective, subjects with LCA will show higher acceptance to behaviors with negative expressions as a form of reprimand when they violate COVID-19 guidelines. Those with HCA will show higher acceptance to polite reprimands when they are violating WHO guidelines. </p>
            
          <br>
          <p>
            To evaluate the hypotheses, we conducted a video-based subjective experiment (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476976/media#media">See main paper for details</a>)

      <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2>
      <font size="4">

      <p>
        As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the entire globe, we investigated how adequately a robot’s harmonized expressive behaviors (polite, gentle, displeased, and angry) can
        be effectively utilized to elicit adherence to WHO guidelines on social distancing and wearing masks. We subjectively evaluated the perception of three attitudinal behaviors (polite/gentle,
        displeased, and angry) of a robot as reprimand functionalities for admonishment in situations where these guidelines were being continuously ignored, while bearing in mind that not
        everyone shares the same perspectives (sense of values regarding compliance awareness) on the need to uphold them
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <p>
        Our subjective evaluation results first indicated that the robot’s behaviors with both positive and negative expressions were correctly perceived by all subjects. From a third person perspective,
        subjects with lower levels of compliance awareness (LCA) for the need to adhere toWHO guidelines showed greater preference for polite/gentle reprimands to violations of these guidelines as both appropriate and effective behaviors. On the other hand,
        those with higher levels of compliance awareness (HCA) had higher preference for polite/gentle behaviors in terms of appropriateness toward third-party violators, but they also appraised
        the negative expressions (displeased and angry behaviors) as more effective in enforcing compliance for such people
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        From an individual perspective, our subjective evaluation revealed that almost all the participants would obey a robot’s reprimand. Most of the subjects in the HCA group would obey the robot’s behavior with both positive and negative expressions,
        while those in the LCA group would tend to obey its reprimands, partly to positive or negative expressions. Further analysis must clarify which individuals in the LCA group would adhere to positive or negative expressions.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        Our current findings are relevant to the HRI field because they offer insight about the need for furnishing robots with behaviors that are not only situation dependent but also cognizant of an interlocutor’s sense of values on the interaction’s subject.
